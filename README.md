VRV Security Frontend Assignment

This repository contains the front-end code for my project, originally developed as a part of an academc assignment. It is now being submitted for consideration for the frontend intern position at VRV Security. The project is build using J2EE and focused on creating a user-friendly and responsive Role-Based Access Control(RBAC) interface.


Project Overview

In modern e-healthcare systems, patients can share encrypted personal healthcare records (PHRs) with doctors or medical research institutions, enabling high-quality medical services. However, challenges arise due to the difficulty in effectively searching encrypted data and the continuous availability requirements for doctors during the medical treatment process.
To address these issues, we propose DSAS, a secure and practical proxy searchable re-encryption scheme. Our solution ensures the privacy and usability of PHRs while supporting remote monitoring and research.
The RBAC UI is designed to help administrators manage users, roles, and permissions, offering functionalities to:
Only admin can authorize users
And allows them to access their functionalities

Features:

Privacy and Security: PHRs are encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud, ensuring confidentiality.
Access Control: Only authorized doctors or research institutions can access the encrypted PHRs.
Delegation Support: Doctors-in-charge can delegate specific research or medical tasks to other doctors or institutions through the cloud, minimizing information exposure.
Dashboard:
View a comprehensive overview of users and their roles in the system.
Manage Users:
View and authorize users.
Manage Permissions:
Assign and modify permissions for roles dynamically.


Technologies Used:

The project utilizes J2EE, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java for the frontend development. 
The backend is implemented using Servlets, while MySQL serves as the database.

Getting Started:
To run the project follow these steps:
1.Clone the project, clone the code to your local machine
2. Install all required applications like 
MySQL work bench
Install apache software Foundation
3.Select Tomcat
4.Then create a folder in webapps and pace all this code there
5.Now go to bin and start tomcat.exe
6.Go to the browser and run localhost:2024/
7. select manager app
8.Now click on the folder name where  you stored the code
9.Login with admin-admin credentials
10.Now login with credentials
For admin-cloud,cloud
then permit registered users

Thank you:

Thank you for checking out my project. I hope this guide gas helped you understand the features and functionalities of the RBAC UI.
